  
Evaluates two inputs (A and B) with a specified comparison operators and optional values for successful and failed comparisons. The node performs the specified operation element-wise between corresponding elements of A and B. If the comparison is successful for all elements, it returns the success value; otherwise, it returns the failure value. The node supports various comparison operators such as EQUAL, GREATER\_THAN, LESS\_THAN, AND, OR, IS, IN, etc.
