  
Generate a constant image or mask of a specified size and color. It can be used to create solid color backgrounds or matte images for compositing with other visual elements. The node allows you to define the desired width and height of the output and specify the RGBA color value for the constant output. Additionally, you can input an optional image to use as a matte with the selected color.
