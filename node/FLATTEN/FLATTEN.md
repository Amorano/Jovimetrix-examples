  
Combine multiple input images into a single image by summing their pixel values. This operation is useful for merging multiple layers or images into one composite image, such as combining different elements of a design or merging masks. Users can specify the blending mode and interpolation method to control how the images are combined. Additionally, a matte can be applied to adjust the transparency of the final composite image.
