### JOVIMETRIX üî∫üü©üîµ/COMPOSE
  
Combine multiple input images into a single image by summing their pixel values. This operation is useful for merging multiple layers or images into one composite image, such as combining different elements of a design or merging masks. Users can specify the blending mode and interpolation method to control how the images are combined. Additionally, a matte can be applied to adjust the transparency of the final composite image.

| Name | Type | Description | Default | Meta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MODE | STRING | Decide whether the images should be resized to fit a specific dimension. Available modes include scaling to fit within given dimensions or keeping the original size | MATTE | MATTE, CROP, FIT, ASPECT, ASPECT SHORT, RESIZE MATTE |
| üáºüá≠ | VEC2INT | Width and Height as a Vector2 (x,y) | [512, 512] |  |
| üéûÔ∏è | STRING | Select the method for resizing images. Options range from nearest neighbor to advanced methods like Lanczos, ensuring the best quality for the specific use case | LANCZOS4 | NEAREST, LINEAR, CUBIC, AREA, LANCZOS4, LINEAR EXACT, NEAREST EXACT |
| MATTE | VEC4INT | Define a background color for padding, if necessary. This is useful when images do not fit perfectly into the designated area and need a filler color | [0, 0, 0, 255] |  |
