  
Calculate linear interpolation between two values or vectors based on a blending factor (alpha).  
  
The node accepts optional start (IN\_A) and end (IN\_B) points, a blending factor (FLOAT), and various input types for both start and end points, such as single values (X, Y), 2-value vectors (IN\_A2, IN\_B2), 3-value vectors (IN\_A3, IN\_B3), and 4-value vectors (IN\_A4, IN\_B4).  
  
Additionally, you can specify the easing function (EASE) and the desired output type (TYPE). It supports various easing functions for smoother transitions.
