### JOVIMETRIX üî∫üü©üîµ/UTILITY
  
Manage a queue of specific items: media files. Supports various image and video formats. You can specify the current index for the queue item, enable pausing the queue, or reset it back to the first index. The node outputs the current item in the queue, the entire queue, the current index, and the total number of items in the queue.
