  
Sends frames to a specified route, typically for live streaming or recording purposes. It accepts tensors representing images and allows configuration of parameters such as route, resolution, scaling mode, interpolation method, and matte color. The node continuously streams frames to the specified route, enabling real-time visualization or recording of processed video data.
